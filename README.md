# Franka LLM - Active Development Branch

This is **NOT** the **active development branch**.

## Branch Structure

- **`main`** - Stable baseline for milestone releases
- **`dev`** - Active development (current branch)
- **`demo-roel-feb11-2026`** - Demo version shown to supervisor Roel on Feb 11, 2026
- **`demo-roel-feb20-2026`** - Demo version shown to supervisor Roel on Feb 20, 2026

## Workflow

After reaching a milestone, a new branch will be created from that point to preserve the state, and development continues here.

For detailed setup and usage instructions, see **main** branch.
