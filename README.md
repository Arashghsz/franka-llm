This is the **active development branch** where new features and improvements are being implemented.

## Branch Structure

- **`main`** - Stable baseline for milestone releases
- **`dev`** - Active development (current branch)
- **`demo-roel-feb11-2026`** - Demo version shown to supervisor Roel on Feb 11, 2026
